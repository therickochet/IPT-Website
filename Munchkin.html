	<h3>Munchkin Cat</h3>
    <img src="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/27/cf/cd/27cfcd2fefc4db6d3de473e3f7c7f00b.jpg" alt="Munchkin Cat" width="350" height="300" align="left">
 	<p>The Munchkin is a relatively new breed of cat characterized by its very short legs, which are caused by a genetic mutation.The Munchkin cat is a medium-sized cat with a long body, walnut-shaped eyes and triangular ears. Because of a mutation it has short and stubby legs; this is also the cat's most recognizable feature. The Munchkin, however, is in no way handicapped by its legs and does have regularly-sized forelegs that are equal in length. The cat comes in short-haired and long-haired varieties, both sporting an all-weather coat. In this way, the Munchkin cat is similar to the Persian Cat and American Shorthair.</p>
 	<br>
 	<p>These short-legged cats are confident, outgoing and not the least bit self conscious about their unusual look. The Munchkin cat loves to play and wrestle with its friends, and is frequently dubbed the magpies of the cat species because it often borrows small, shiny objects and stashes them away for later play. The Munchkin also has a hunterâ€™s instinct and will chase mice or anything that moves, but at the end of the day it looks for nothing more than to snuggle into your lap and nag until it is petted.</p>
