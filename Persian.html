 	<p>The Persian cat is a long-haired breed of cat characterized by its round face and short muzzle.The Persian is the most popular pedigreed cat in North America, if not the world. Persians take their name from the country where they are thought to have originated. They became popular pets in animal-mad Victorian Britain and were seen at the very first cat shows in that country. Persians have always been bred to have a round head, short face, snub nose, chubby cheeks and a short, cobby body, but over time those features have become exaggerated.  It has a resemblance to the Turkish Angora and the Munchkin.</p>

 	<p>Persians are gentle, quiet cats who like a serene environment and people who treat them kindly. Unlike more athletic cats, they prefer lounging on a sofa to scaling the heights of your bookcase or fireplace mantel. Children are acceptable to the Persian as long as they are content to simply pet him and not drag him around or dress him up. On the other hand, the Persian may be a welcome guest at a little girlâ€™s tea party and will bat decorously at a peacock feather before returning to pose beautifully on his sofa. In general, just make sure children treat this cat with the gentle respect he deserves.</p>
